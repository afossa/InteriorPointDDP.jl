inertia(B::BunchKaufman; atol::Real=0, rtol::Real=atol>0 ? 0 : n*ϵ) ->
    np::Union{Nothing,Integer}, nn::Union{Nothing,Integer}, nz::Integer

`inertia` computes the numerical inertia (the number of positive,
negative and zero eigenvalues, given by `np`, `nn` and `nz`,
respectively) of a real symmetric of Hermitian matrix `B` that has been
factored using the Bunch-Kaufman algorithm. For complex symmetric
matrices the inertia is not defined. in that case `np` and `nn` are set
to `nothing`, but the function still returns the number of zero
eigenvalues. The inertia is computed by counting the eigenvalues signs
of `B.D`. The number of zero eigenvalues is computed as the number of
estimated eigenvalues with complex 1-norm (defined as `|re(.)|+|im(.)|`)
less or equal than `max(atol, rtol*s₁)`, where `s₁` is an upper bound of
the largest singular value of `B.D`, `σ₁` (more specifically,
`0.5*s₁ <= σ₁ <= s₁` for real matrices and `0.35*s₁ <= σ₁ <= s₁` for
complex matrices). `atol` and `rtol` are the absolute and relative
tolerances, respectively. The default relative tolerance is `n*ϵ`, where
`n` is the size of  of `A`, and `ϵ` is the [`eps`](@ref) of the number
type of `A`, if this type is a subtype of `AbstractFloat`. In any other
case (if the number type of `A` is `Rational`, for example) `ϵ` is set
to `0`.

!!! note
    Numerical inertia can be a sensitive and imprecise characterization of
    ill-conditioned matrices with eigenvalues that are close in magnitude to the
    threshold tolerance `max(atol, rtol*s₁)`. In such cases, slight perturbations
    to the Bunch-Kaufman computation or to the matrix can change the result of
    `rank` by pushing one or more eigenvalues across the threshold. These
    variations can even occur due to changes in floating-point errors between
    different Julia versions, architectures, compilers, or operating systems.
    In particular, the size of the entries of the tringular factor directly
    influende the scale of the eigenvalues of the diagonal factor, so it is
    strongly recommended to use rook pivoting is the inertia is going to be
    computed.
    On the other hand, if the matrix has rational entries, the inertia
    computation is guaranteed is to be exact, as long as there is no
    under/overflow in the underlying integer type (and in such cases Julia itself
    throws an error), or a positive tolerance (absolute or relative) is
    specified.
